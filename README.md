# inovarmais-discord-bot

A bot to fetch summaries and tasks from InovarMais and send them to Discord.

## Configuration

Edit them to fit your needs.
The `url` in the profiles config is the URL of the web app without the `/app` path.

Pass a `TOKEN` environment variable with the Discord Bot Token when starting the app.
